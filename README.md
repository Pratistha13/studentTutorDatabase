# studentTutorDatabase
This is a final project for Server Programming course. I have done a simple CRUD application. This was created using SpringBoot, Bootstrap, and Spring Security. This web app is linked to PostgreSQL database which is then deployed to HEROKU. The app contains two demo users: user/user (role=USER) and admin/admin (role=ADMIN).
The main objective of this is to create a database of students and tutors. Also to be able to edit the information provided. I have also used the contact form to send email to the admin. I have also tried to apply the upload file features.
